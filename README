PixSpace README

Database Creation
 In order to run the PixSpace Server, you will first need to setup a MySQL 
 database. If you want to run the scripts yourself, the creation script is 
 "db_scripts/mysql_db_create.sql", and the deletion script is 
 "db_scripts/mysql_db_delete.sql". The creation script will create a 
 "pixspace" database and a "pixspace" user with a password of "pixspace". The 
 deletion script will delete the "pixspace" database and user.

The database creation script can be executed with the following command. 
 mysql -u root -p -h DB_HOSTNAME < db_scripts/mysql_db_create.sql

Building PixSpace
 PixSpace Client and PixSpace Server can be built via the command line using the
 following commands.

 cd pixspace/
 mkdir build/
 cd build/
 qmake ../trunk/
 make

 This will also build the static library, and the unit tests.

 If you are not running the MySQL server locally on the default port, an error 
 message will appear reporting that the simulation will not work unless the 
 configuration is updated. To remedy this, switch to the "Server Configuration" 
 tab, update the MySQL configuration to refect your setup, then restart 
 PixSpace Server.

 To execute PixSpace Server run: 
  ./Server/pixspaceserver

 To execute PixSpace Client run:
  ./Client/pixspaceclient
